                //ðŸš€ Day 4 Challenge: Start Coding! ðŸš€//
// Q10:Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs youâ€™ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
//If you donâ€™t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
//just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence 
//describing what the program does.

//Program 1 // File 1
//My name is Mehwish Naz
//Dated: 19/02/1997
console.log('Hellow world simple program');
//Program 2 //File 2
//My name is Mehwish Naz
//Dated: 19/02/2024
console.log(5*2);

// Q11:Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a array called names. Print each personâ€™s 
//name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time. //
let members_names = ['sana', 'ayesha', 'nimra', 'kinza'];
for (let i = 0; i < members_names.length; i++) 
    {console.log(members_names[i]);}

// Q12: Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each personâ€™s
//name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should
//be personalized with the personâ€™s name.//
let names: string [] =["sana", "ayesha", "munza", "inza", "bisma"];
let massage: string = "Do you like to read some books?"
console.log(names[0] + " "+ massage);
console.log(names[1]+ " " + massage);
console.log(names[2]+ " " + massage);
console.log(names[3]+ " " + massage);
console.log(names[4]+ " " + massage);
